I have not even tried the trace tools last month and I run into even more tracing resources. 
- [Full Stack Tracing Part2](https://www.kdab.com/full-stack-tracing-part-2)
- [Full Stack Tracing Part3](https://www.kdab.com/full-stack-tracing-part-3)
>Part2 talks about how to setup and capture trace using LTTng. Part3 talks about how to visualize the trace captured. LTTng captures in Common Trace Format. Part3 talks about Chrome trace format and a conversion tool from Common Trace Format to Chrome trace format.
- [uftrace](https://github.com/namhyung/uftrace)
>This tool traces a program compiled with -pg flag. Then, the uftrace command line util can dynamically add instrumentation code to trace the file. It can capture call tree, input parameter of a function, output value of a function. I don't know how it will handle c++ objects / stl container as input and output.
- [ARM-Tracer](https://github.com/scotty-kdw/ARM-Tracer)
>This tool is an ARM-Linux tool to capture binary instruction trace for ARM-Linux user space application.
- [Perfetto](https://perfetto.dev)
>This is the tracing system on Android. It can work for Linux too. It can trace Andorid system level events. C++ application can use SDK to emit trace. Application can define its custom event using protobuf. The protobuf file is converted via a tool called ProtoZero into source files. It can include these source files and emit trace to the Perfetto daemon.
