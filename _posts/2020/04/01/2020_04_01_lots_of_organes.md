I had caught some kind of cold/flu in Dec, Jan and Feb. Being sicked three times in three consecutive months!

I am committed to stay healthy during this lock down time. I will take lots of vitamin C in by eating a bag of oranges every week.

I am not a fan of oranges, but this bag is exceptionally sweet. If I can continue to buy sweet oranges like those, I would like to keep this habit even after the lock down.
