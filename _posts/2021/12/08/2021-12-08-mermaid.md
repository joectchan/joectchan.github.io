I used online graphviz editor to draw graphs using its dot language. Now, I found two other online graphing tools that look very easy to use.  
* [ZenUML](https://app.zenuml.com/) Its language is similar to C++/Java syntax.
* [Mermaid](https://mermaid.live/) Its language is similar to markdown.

I found a html snippet that should invoke mermaid online and send a diagram text for it to render. Hope you will be able to see it below.

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js"></script>
<script>
    mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true });
</script>

Here is one mermaid diagram:
<div class="mermaid">
graph TD
A[Client] --> B[Load Balancer]
B --> C[Server1]
B --> D[Server2]
</div>

And here is another:
<div class="mermaid">
graph TB
    sq[Square shape] --> ci((Circle shape))

    subgraph A
        od>Odd shape]-- Two line<br/>edge comment --> ro
        di{Diamond with <br/> line break} -.-> ro(Rounded<br>square<br>shape)
        di==>ro2(Rounded square shape)
    end

    %% Notice that no text in shape are added here instead that is appended further down
    e --> od3>Really long text with linebreak<br>in an Odd shape]

    %% Comments after double percent signs
    e((Inner / circle<br>and some odd <br>special characters)) --> f(,.?!+-*ز)

    cyr[Cyrillic]-->cyr2((Circle shape Начало));

     classDef green fill:#9f6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px;
     classDef orange fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;
     class sq,e green
     class di orange
</div>

I embedded this html code block into this Jekyll post to make the first graph.
```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js"></script>
<script>
    mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true });
</script>

Here is one mermaid diagram:
<div class="mermaid">
graph TD
A[Client] --> B[Load Balancer]
B --> C[Server1]
B --> D[Server2]
</div>
```
The code of the second graph came from [](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/examples)
