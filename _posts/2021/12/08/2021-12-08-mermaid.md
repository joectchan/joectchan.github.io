I used online graphviz editor to draw graphs using its dot language. Now, I found two other online graphing tools that look very easy to use.  
* [ZenUML](https://app.zenuml.com/) Its language is similar to C++/Java syntax.
* [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/n00b-overview) Its language is similar to markdown.

I found a html snippet that should invoke mermaid online and send a diagram text for it to render. Hope you will be able to see it below.

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid/dist/mermaid.min.js"></script>
<script>
    mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true });
</script>

Here is one mermaid diagram:
<div class="mermaid">
    graph TD A[Client] --> B[Load Balancer] B --> C[Server1] B --> D[Server2]
</div>

And here is another:
<div class="mermaid">
    graph TD A[Client] -->|tcp_123| B(Load Balancer) B -->|tcp_456| C[Server1] B
    -->|tcp_456| D[Server2]
</div>
